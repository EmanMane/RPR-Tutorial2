Tutorial 2


Task 1
Create a Maven program that calculates the sine and factorial of a given number. The application should be a console application that receives input from the command line using the args parameter in the main function. A class to compute these functions must be created. After completing the task, you should push it to your new Github repository.

Task 2
Create a program that respects the structure shown in the figure below (of course, write the program using knowledge of inheritance). Comment on the task with the tutor. The project should be Maven and you should push it to your new Github repository.
  
Task 3
Create a program that enters numbers and saves them in a list. If you have entered "stop", the program stops, and on another word/letter it repeats the entry, otherwise it calculates the following: min, max, mean and standard deviation. For implementation, it is necessary to use the java.util.List class. As with the previous projects, the project should be Maven and should be pushed to your github repository.
